# Miracle Spring Water's Neovim Config

*I've spent way too much time configuring this...
If you found something useful here, you are lost! <3*

## TODO
- [ ] Determine and list dependencies (system dependencies, like ripgrep for telescope)
- [ ] Make install/setup instructions (maybe with bootstrap script if necessary)
- [ ] Switch colorscheme to [gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim) with custom overrides (not a fan
      of the defaults.
- [ ] Refactor [lsp](lua/dream/lsp.lua) (and mason-tool-installer.lua) into own lsp/ directory
- [ ] Debugging with [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)
- [ ] Custom keybinding for each [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) source
- [ ] Write custom snippets to be used by [luasnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)
      and make them appear in the [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) sources (so I don't have to use 
      [miraclespringwater/friendlysnippets](https://github.com/miraclespringwater/friendly-snippets/tree/msw-custom)
- [ ] Implement/configure [which-key.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim)
- [ ] Implement/configure [zen-mode.nvim](https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim) for coding
- [ ] Implement/configure [twilight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim) for coding
- [ ] Implement/configure [limelight.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim) for writing *
- [ ] Implement/configure [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) for writing *

*\* Note: zen-mode and twilight may replace goyo and limelight respectively if they
are useful for writing as well, TBD*
